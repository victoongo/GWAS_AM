A GWAS project to study human assortative mating using data from the Framingham Heart Study and Health and Retirement Study. The primary objective of this study is to test whether the genetic correlation between married couples are higher then unrelated random opposite sex pairs. 

Most of the programs were created in 2011 to run on the Linux scientific computing cluster "killdevil" at UNC - Chapel Hill. The analysis was rerun in 2012 and again in 2013 to address reviewer comments with minor changes. Close to 2 billion mixed models were performed for each run. 

Plink, Shell scripting, Stata, and SAS were used to carry out the data manipulation and analysis.
